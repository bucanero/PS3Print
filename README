PS3Print is based on Scognito's sconsole. (http://scognito.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/sconsole-a-simple-function-for-printing-strings-on-ps3/)


PS3Print is a simple class written in C++ and it helps you out visualizing strings on the PS3 screen. this library works
with PSL1GHT but its not tied to it.

This library only has 3 main files.


* Debug.h
* Debug.cpp
* console_fonts.h

Just place the Debug.h and console_fonts.h under the "include" folder and Debug.cpp under the "source" folder.


Usage:

#include "Debug.h"

//Make sure to init the Debug class.
//by default it uses a black font with a transparent background.
Debug::Init(screenWidth, screenHeight);


//And just feel free to call any of the functions.

Debug::FontColor(FONT_COLOR_BLACK);
Debug::Log(0.025, 0.025, "This is a normal string!", *buffer);

Debug::FontColor(FONT_COLOR_GREEN);
Debug::Log(0.25, 0.25, "This is another green string!" + str, *buffer);

Debug::FontColor(0x00ff00ff); //purple, colors have the syntax 0xAARRGGBB
Debug::Log(0.5, 0.5, "Frame: " + LongToString(frame), *buffer);

//Draws the error message on a Red Background with Yellow Letters.		
Debug::LogError(0.75, 0.75, "This is an error message!!!", *buffer);

// Draws the warning message with a transparent background and yellow Letters
Debug::LogWarning(0.8, 0.95, "This is a warning message :O", *buffer);


Position values (x,y) go from 0 to 1 where 0,0 is the top left corner of the screen and
1,1 is the botom right side of the screen




Check the "example" folder for a ready to compile example; just type "make pkg"


Feel free to do whatever you want with this.
I dont take any responsibility of any damage this library can cause.
